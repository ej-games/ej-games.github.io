		Welcome to the first sporadic review from Vectarray - reviewing the Nikon Coolpix L340, one of the most affordable bridge cameras on the
		market. Despite only being first released in 2015, this camera features a 20 megapixel sensor, and 28x optical zoom. A good deal for
		a camera you can get for less than Â£150 second-hand.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Technical Specs</h4>
		<img class="leftImage image-zoom" src="/blog/images/240903nikon-coolpix-l340-front.JPG" style="width: 40%;">
		<br>The Coolpix features:
		<ul style="overflow: auto; margin-top: 0;">
			<li>28x optical zoom</li>
			<li>20 MP sensor (5164x3873 at 4:3)</li>
			<li>Automatic scene detection</li>
			<li>Continuous autofocus</li>
			<li>720p HD video at 30fps</li>
			<li>ISO sensitivity up to 1600</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		While this is a great basic bashed-up compact camera, it's got a few features for the intermediate photographers. Just imagine what you can do
		with customisable exposure settings!
		<br><br>But unfortunately, to cut costs, Nikon decided they wouldn't put a rechargeable battery in this camera. Which
		means for the rest of your life, you will be swapping out 4 AA batteries in and out of the camera, until you drop dead,
		probably still with a pack of batteries in your hand.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Image Quality</h4>
		Yes, the resolution of this camera is acceptable, and 20 MP is plenty for basically every personal use case.
		<br>But, the colours in the photos from this camera are sub-par, although it is impossible to take a photo that
		displays the problem fully. Compare these two photos of spools of wire:
		<br>
		<h5 class="left">Nikon</h5>
		<h5 class="right">Samsung Galaxy</h5>
		<div class="clear"></div>

		<img class="leftImage image-zoom" style="width: 45%" src="/blog/images/240903nikon-demo-flash.JPG">
		<img class="rightImage image-zoom" style="width: 45%" src="/blog/images/240903samsung-demo-flash.jpg">

		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div>
		The left photo, taken by the Nikon, is slightly less saturated - while it's not fully visible in the spools of wire themselves,
		the wooden desk underneath is much more washed out. Being the owner of the desk, I can fully confirm that the phone's
		picture was more true to the real desk colour.

		<h3>Video Quality</h3>
		The video quality of the Coolpix is very underwhelming. Colour in the videos is almost non-existent.
		<br><br>
		<video controls width="100%" src="/blog/images/240903nikon-video-quality.mp4"></video>
		Compare that to the colour depth of the photos, and you'll see that filming with the Nikon is practically useless - you'd
		be better off using your phone. Unless your phone video quality is even worse.

		<div class="divider"></div>

		<h4>Ease of Use</h4>
		The Nikon's user experience can only really be described as Standard. All of the buttons are in the same place
		as most other cameras, there are sufficient ports for most needs, and there are plenty of menu items.
		<br><br>There are only a few problems I have experienced with this great high-quality camera:
		<h3>Deleting Items</h3>
		Yes, it's a real pain when you delete a photo that you wanted to keep. Well, it's now a thing of the past, with the Nikon
		Coolpix L340's ultra-secure deletion system.
		<br>Here's how to use it:
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 1</b>: Open up the photo menu
		<br>
		<b>Step 2</b>: Press the delete key in the bottom right
		<br>
		<b>Step 3</b>: Press "OK" to select "Delete current image"
		<br>
		<b>Step 4</b>: Press the up arrow to navigate to "Yes" when asked, "Are you sure?"
		<br>
		<b>Step 5</b>: Press "OK" to finally delete the image!

		<br><br>You may be thinking, "surely there's a way to delete multiple images!" Well, you'd be absolutely right.
		<br>But if you had thought, "surely there's a <i>quick</i> way to delete multiple images!", then you'd be wrong.
		<br><br>Instead of selecting "Delete current images", you can select "Delete selected images". This will open up
		a menu with a grid of photos. Simple - just navigate through the grid and delete the photos you want. Except it's not "Simple - ",
		because the grid you're shown isn't actually a grid, it's just a list of photos that has multiple layers. Meaning, you can't go up and
		down. So the experience of deleting multiple photos is like the experience of navigating through a Word document using only the left
		and right arrow keys.

		<h3>Lens Motor</h3>
		This may just be a problem with my model, but it's still a problem.
		<br>The motor controlling the zoom lens on the camera is not only slow, but begging to be set free. When you zoom in, it makes
		a sort of whimpering sound and takes a fair while to fully zoom to 28x, which is especially annoying when you find a moving object
		at a distance.
		<br><br>This isn't the only psychological issue with the motor - it also has incredibly low confidence. When you're zooming back
		out, and you stop, the camera sort of second-guesses itself, and moves the lens back out slightly. Making another slightly sad motor noise.
		
		<h3>Good things about the camera</h3>
		It's cheap. And has good zoom for the price. That's all.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		Yes, I know I keep coming back to the price, but the camera is cheap, and has a good number of features. If you want image quality,
		pick a different camera, but if you want one that just gets the job done, and can capture memories and all that sentimental stuff,
		then this one's fine.
