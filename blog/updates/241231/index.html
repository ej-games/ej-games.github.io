		2025 - the first square number year since 1936. Only around 500,000 people in the UK will have ever experienced two square
		years in their life. What a pointless fact.

		<br><br>But, here's something more pointless: this blog post. I'll be detailing my plans for the new year, and some updates I'm
		making to the website and such.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>YouTube</h4>
		Funny how I said this just a year ago. Oh, no, that was 2 years ago. Well.
		<br>I will make another attempt at YouTube channel stuff. Instead of focussing on Unity and programming, I would kind of like to show
		some electronic stuff which combines with music. 
		<br><br>I've already got a video planned for how "bit-crushers" work in music, as well as creating my own version of the internet.
		<br><small>What does he mean! He can't make the internet by himself!</small>
		<br>I'm well aware.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>EJMusic</h4>
		EJMusic has been ticking over for a while. My last Spotify upload in June 2024 was relatively successful, and, at least for me, the
		album featuring my favourite songs.
		<br><br>There should be a new album released shortly after the new year, featuring new songs (what! New songs in a new album!).
		<br>Also, for you Tidal people (zero people), I hope you enjoy the Tidal exclusive song. Have a lovely time listening to my worst
		work yet.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Thank you</h4>
		Thank you everyone reading.
		<br>I know I literally just said there are zero people reading this, but since writing that, I've checked my analytics. There were
		20,000 requests made to my website at 4 AM this morning! That means 20,000 lovely people are interested in my website! All of them from
		Russia as well! So glad to have you here.
		<br><br>But, it's not all good news. I had 3 attack attempts which Cloudflare helpfully avoided. What lovely people they are.

		<br><br>And before you say anything, yes, I'm aware those 20,000 requests were a failed attack attempt. Although it might actually have succeeded.
