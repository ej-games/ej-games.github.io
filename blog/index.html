		Welcome to the blog homepage of EJGames!
		<br><br>This is where most of the blog stuff will be. There will just be different pages for <b>large</b> articles.

		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4 class="moveIn" id="201022">20/10/22 - Todo List &amp; More</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			No, I haven't forgotten about this blog page. I just haven't used it. There's not much to talk about on a slowly-updating website.
			<br><br>But I bet you're <b>really</b> eager to hear what's going on in the mind of EJGames himself! Here it is.


			<h3>Todo List</h3>
			I have been idly making a todo list for about a month now, and I have only just released it. You can see it here: <a href="/app/web-todo.html">https://ejgames.co.uk/app/web-todo</a>
			<br>Here are some of its features:

			<h6>Statuses</h6>
			You can pick between 4 different statuses of how a task is going: Complete, In Progress, On Hold or Not Done!

			<h6>Multiple different lists</h6>
			That's right! With the new EJGames To-Do List, you can customise to your heart's content, because you can make different lists with different items in them! Now that's customisation!
			
			<h6>Third point here</h6>
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
			Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

			<br><br>OK, so maybe it's not the best todo list in the world. But I think it's better than some of the overcomplicated ones out there. I just wanted a thing where you can
			make a task, complete it and tick it. Who knows? It might be a revolutionary idea that's been under everyone's noses the whole time. And if that happens, I may as well
			throw this computer out of the window and hope it flies.

			
			<h3>EJGames Channel?</h3>
			Yes! You read it right! An EJGames YouTube channel! It won't be starting for a while yet because I am very busy right now! Not just making a website but also
			getting on with the important things in my life. As if making a website is not important.
			<br><br>The channel will probably be me making games, or working on my website, with some <b>really</b> funny commentary.
			There will also be some trailers and sneak peaks of what's coming in the next Locked In update. Which means:

			
			<h3>Locked In development MIGHT be back. MIGHT.</h3>
			Yes, it might be, but only while my creativity lasts. It's difficult to work on a game while you have to reskin the entire game. Oh blast! I've just spoiled what I'm doing to
			Locked In! Well, now that I've said that, I may as well reveal that John Gold dies at the end. Ah no! I've done it again!
			<br><small>(He doesn't actually, I was joking.)</small>
			<br><br>But still! I am working on Locked In, for now. Reskinning the entire game. And fixing bugs. And I'm doing all of this to put off writing and creating the story. Oh,
			isn't game development SO EXCITING?
			<br><br>You see, I also have a problem. You know the saying, "go big or go home"? Well, recently, I have definitely not been going home. Remember ConnectCircle? Released it with
			a bunch of bugs? Why can't it go back to that?


			<h3>A request</h3>
			Pleeeease read my tutorials and give feedback on them! I want to help people, so even if you don't need to learn anything, pleeeeease read them! They're going to waste otherwise.
			<br>
			Oh, what's the point. Only about 2 people will read this blog page within the next year.

		<h4 class="moveIn" id="070422">7/4/22 - Controversial Colours Cleared</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			It's been a long time since my idea of adding colour schemes was considered.
			<br>
			And I've realised: colours are, apparently, a very touchy subject. Take the Aqua theme for example. It looked like this:
			<br><br>
			<img src="../images/c-aqua-theme.jpg" style="width: 15em;" class="moveIn">
			<br><br>
			And it was <i>completely</i> 50/50 to whether people liked it or hated it.
			<br><br>
			Some people preferred the Dark theme. Some people preferred the one that was just grey with some blue.
			<br>I wanted to add colour schemes to try and minimalise this. To stop people from hating all of the colours.
			<br><br>Apparently, just the idea of adding another colour is enough to make people dislike it. Even if they don't have to pick it, they will still not like it.
			<br><br>I'm not angry at anyone. Or myself for the idea. It's just...
			<br>Why are opinions so... good at being expressed? It's all the opinion's fault. I'm not friends with Opinion any more.
