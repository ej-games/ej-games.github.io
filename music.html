			My music career has lasted a lot longer than my game-making career, to put it simply.
			<br><br>
			I started making songs in 2017 (first uploaded in 2018), which is about 3 years before I started making games!
			<br>You can find my music YouTube channel (EJMusic) by clicking <a
				href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Frnwv3NJZ2BQqWJhLeLhw">here</a>.
			<br>I may or may not have made the logo in about 5 minutes, and (at that time) did not think a background
			was needed.
			<br><br>Here, you can find all of the songs I haven't uploaded to my YouTube channel - including the Locked In Soundtrack.
			<br><br><b>To any professional music-based employers reading this: yes, I will make professional song names eventually 😊</b>
