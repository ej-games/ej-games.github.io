			ConnectMore was the first proper mobile game that I created, and it's still... playable.
			<br><br>It is only available for Android. To quickly download, click
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=19np3wLMiIoN_MsLEM9eybDcKVC8-WRNx&confirm=t">here</a>.

		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		The aim of ConnectMore, like basically any game, is to get as many points as possible.
		<br><br>However, like basically any game, it's not just as simple as clicking a button.
		<br>Like basically any game, it requires thought and strategy.
		
		<br><br>
		In the game, you control a central block, highlighted with a loveheart, which can move around a grid.
		<br>When the block is next to an occupied square, it will "connect" to the central block, allowing you to control
		"more" of the board.
		
		<br><br>You can keep building patterns, and are awarded based on which patterns you create, as long as you don't
		destroy the central block, or go outside the highlighted area.
		
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Development</h4>
		Yes yes, boring.

		<br><br>
		I started developing ConnectMore in September 2021, and "finished" it in mid to late October that year.
		<br>Since its final update, I have done nothing to it apart from create an APK which you can download for Android.
		Originally, it was iOS only, and only available to me and my App Store Connect team, so only available to me and me.
		<br><br>It all started using some YouTube Audio Library stock music, and a sprite I made with my newly discovered
		"Photo-shop" skills. At the start, in the first stage of development, all you could do was move a cube around that
		connects blocks. Then points were added, then new patterns, then exploding blocks, then coins. Lots of features,
		but overall a generally boring game. What? I don't know where you heard that from.
		
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>What now?</h4>

		The future of ConnectMore is very bleak. Probably going to abandon it as I did with most of my games.
		<br><br>But, in the unlikely event that I continue working on it: expect a lot more polish, and so many
		boring and unbalanced features.
