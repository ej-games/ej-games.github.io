		This is a C# (with references to Unity) tutorial about <b>type arguments</b>. This means that it will be able to be followed in vanilla C#, but will also contain context for Unity users.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Ahem - what?</h4>
		Ahahaha, very funny. Stick together a bunch of foreign-sounding words to sound clever.
		<br>That's not what I'm doing, really! I understand it, at least!
		<br><br>You have no doubt encountered type arguments on your C# journey, whether it be:
		<br><br>
		<span class="code">List&lt;T&gt;</span>

		<div class="imageDescription">Wow! A list! What are they?</div>

		<br>
		<span class="code">GetComponent&lt;T&gt;</span>
		<div class="imageDescription">Only Unity users will understand! ðŸ˜‚</div>

		<br>
		<span class="code">mod.ProjectileType&lt;T&gt;</span>
		<div class="imageDescription">A little snippet from my tModLoader days</div>

		<br><br>And you have no doubt noticed by now that they are the <b>T</b>s in the &lt; and &gt; signs.

		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>


		<h4>What are Types?</h4>
		Stupid question, isn't it? Actually, not as much as you think.
		<br>Types are not just your regular <code>int</code>s or <code>string</code>s, or even your custom classes like, for example, <code>Weapon</code>. They are their own special class that has a variant for every other class you make.
		<br><br>That's some bad explaining. Here's an example of just a weapon class with just one field, and a constructor (tutorial <a href="csharp-constructors.html">here</a>):
<pre><code>public class Weapon
{
	public int damage;


	public Weapon(int damage)
	{
		this.damage = damage;
	}
}
</code>
</pre>
		The class is called Weapon, so you could do
		<br><br><code>Weapon ak47 = new Weapon(10);</code>
		to make a weapon that does 10 damage. If you had actually been bothered to make it deal damage.
		<br><br>But, if you wanted to get the actual <i>Type</i>, for whatever reason, you wouldn't be able to just do something like <code>var weaponType = Weapon;</code> because that (for some reason) doesn't work.
		<br><br>Instead, you would do either:
		<br><code>var weaponType = typeof(Weapon);</code>
		<br>or
		<br><code>var weaponType = Weapon.GetType();</code>
		Which will return a <code>Type</code> class, not a <code>Weapon</code> class.


		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>


		<h4>How do you use Type Arguments?</h4>
		Glad you asked! You didn't really, did you? Whatever.
		<br>You use them just as I did: put the Type (<span class="code">T</span>) in the &lt; and &gt;.

		<br><br>In this section of the tutorial, I will just show you how to use them! If you already know how to use them (ahem, Unity users?) then you can just go on ahead to the
		section below on <b>how to make methods with type arguments</b>.
		<br>But, if you don't have any idea how to use a type argument (or just want some more explanation), then keep reading!

		<br><br>Take the Unity example above: <span class="code">GetComponent&lt;T&gt;</span> - you would usually use it like this, where <code>AudioSource</code> is the type:
		<pre><code>void Start()
{
	AudioSource loadIn = player.GetComponent<red>&lt;</red>AudioSource<red>&gt;</red>;
	loadIn.Play();
}
</code></pre>

		Simple enough, isn't it? Just put your type in the triangular brackets.
		<br><i>Just saying, there is an alternative, and it isn't pretty:</i>
		<pre><code>AudioSource loadIn = player.GetComponent(typeof(AudioSource)) as AudioSource;
</code></pre>
		That's just a pain.

		<h4>How do you <i>make</i> a type argument?</h4>
		Did you skip the above, or read it because you didn't know? Leave a comment in the comment section down below. (Poetry Corner)
		<br><br>Poetry aside, I will now tell you, step by step, how to make a type argument, and what <i>not</i> to do.

		<div class="smallSpace"></div>

		<h5>Step 1 - Make your function</h5>
		This part is simple: just make a function. Or "method", or whatever. Here's an example, and I'll make it as multi-purpose as possible so you can copy and paste to your needs.

<pre><code>public class Lettuce
{
	public void TransmutateLettuce()
	{
		
	}
}
</code></pre>

		Now that you've got your lettuce transmutator, we can move on to the next step:

		<div class="smallSpace"></div>
		
		<h5>Step 2 - Add triangular brackets</h5>
		We've done it before above, but this time, we'll actually be adding the T in ourselves!

<pre><code>public void TransmutateLettuce<green>&lt;T&gt;</green>()
{

}
</code></pre>
		Now, the <code>T</code> can be used just like any other variable - it effectively is a variable, but with a set datatype of <code>Type</code>.

		<div class="smallSpace"></div>

		<h5>Step 3 - Add your base type</h5>
		What does that mean, then? It means we need to put in something to make sure that all of our <code>T</code> arguments <a href="csharp-inheritance.html" class="hover"><hide>View tutorial</hide>inherit</a>
		from a specific class. We don't want to have lettuce transmutating into a string or something.
		<br>So, assuming we have some other classes like <code>BabyGem</code> or <code>Iceberg</code> (inheriting from Lettuce):

<pre><code>public void TransmutateLettuce&lt;T&gt;()<green> where T : Lettuce</green>
{

}
</code></pre>
		In English, this function says
		<br>"Transmutate the lettuce into THIS (T) type, where T must be some sort of lettuce."

		<div class="smallSpace"></div>

		<h5>Step 4 - Do the actual function</h5>
		I have no idea how to transmutate a lettuce in C#, so I'll just give you some examples of how to use your new Type argument.
<pre><code>public void TransmutateLettuce&lt;T&gt;() where T : Lettuce
{
	// Create a new class with the Type argument:
	var newClass = new T();

	// Make a variable with the Type argument:
	T myVariable = ...;

	// You can't perform any functions on the Type argument, because it's a Type, not an instance of the class.
	// (I believe) you can call static methods, assuming the base class has static methods:
	T.InitialiseLettuce();
}
</code></pre>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Post-note</h4>
		I apologise if there are too many foreign words that I have slapped together.
		<br>You can hopefully look them up, but if you still don't understand, then do NOT go on Stack Overflow, because they'll start shouting more
		foreign words at you, like "Singleton" and "Deserialise" for no reason.
