	<h2>C# Hello World</h2>
	<div class="smallSpace"></div>
	<div class="mainParagraph">

		This is an introduction to how you can, and/or should, set up a C# working environment. This is just one way you can do it.
		If this way doesn't work for you, don't burst into tears, because you can follow another tutorial and come back later. I've got nothing to lose,
		this website brings in exactly Â£0 per year.
		
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>C#? .NET? What?</h4>
		When you look up "how to install C#", you're probably met with a bunch of ".NET" nonsense.
		<br><br>Unless C just so happens to be your least favourite letter (F is also available), C# and .NET are practically the same thing.
		If you install .NET, you'll be able to program in C#, because .NET is just the voodoo magic which allows the computer to understand C#.
		<br><br>
		<orange-callout>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-warning"></i><b>But .NET Framework is not the same</b>
			<br>.NET Framework is a version of .NET which is effectively "refreshed" but never updated. You should probably not substitute
			.NET Framework for any other version of .NET, but you can if you read up on what that entails.
		</orange-callout>
		
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Installing .NET</h4>
		You can install .NET by clicking <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">here</a>. I don't get any money from that link or anything,
		I just like subtle hyperlinks...
		<br>To follow any of these "basic programs" C# tutorials, download any .NET version above 6.0. My other tutorials have 
		archaic code that wasn't even correct when I wrote it, because I didn't program in C# properly at that time.
		<br><br>
		After following the installation steps, looking up anything you need to install .NET, you can also install <b>Visual Studio Code</b>,
		which makes C# development much easier.
		<br><br>
		Once that is installed following the steps and also looking stuff up, make sure you restart your computer.
		"Wah, wah, can't be bothered". Well, maybe for once, <i>be</i> bothered. You might not be able to program in C# without it!!

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Setting up a project</h4>
		After restarting, you can now open your fresh copy of Visual Studio Code (I will call it VSCode because I'm lazy). Once you load
		in, do what it says until you reach some Copilot or Customisation page. Ignore that, and instead, go to the left side of the window
		and select the picture of the four squares that opens the "extensions" menu.
		<br><br>Search for "C# Dev Kit", then find and install it.
		<br><br>Once that's installed, go into your File Explorer or Finder or WhatEverOnLinux and create a folder where you want to store your project.
		Call it something suitable, or unsuitable if you want. I'm not your mum. Although if she ever sees <i>that</i> project name, she's going
		to be ashamed.
		<br><br>Go back into VSCode and press <b>Ctrl+K</b>, THEN <b>Ctrl+O</b>, with a pause in between where you're not touching any keys.
		Now select the folder you just tirelessly created.
		<br><br>To finally create your C# project, press <b>Ctrl+Shift+P</b>, then search for ".NET: New Project..." and select it. Select 'Console App'
		from the list, then put in your preferred horrible project name, then if you want to be really careful, you can check the project folder
		is the correct one.
		<br><br>Wait for it to do its thing, then click the "Explorer" button on the left-hand side, with the picture of two pieces of paper.
		Then open whatever folders you need to find "Program.cs" in the list.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Running the Program</h4>
		I'm sorry, I can't help you if this next step doesn't go to plan, because I don't know the innards of VSCode very well. But luckily,
		there are 8 billion other people on the planet, and I'm sure at least one of them has posted their knowledge about VSCode which you 
		can use to help you.
		<br><br>In Program.cs, press <b>F5</b>, then select 'C#' or '.NET Core' or something along those lines. If all goes well, there should be
		a short wait, then you should get the following output:
<pre><code class="language-txt">&gt; Hello, World!</code></pre>
		underneath a bunch of gibberish and unimportant stuff. Well done, you have now C-sharped.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Showing your imaginary friends</h4>

		Picture this: your imaginary friend Short Shaun (what a great lad he is) wants to check out your cool program. But he doesn't have Visual 
		Studio installed, nor does he want to download it! Well, don't worry Shaun, you'll be able to see the code soon enough.

		<br><br>In your project folder, find a subfolder called "bin". Then open "Debug", then open "net8.0", or "net" plus whatever version you
		installed. Inside there is all of the stuff required to run your program, which is updated whenever you run it with VSCode.
		<br><br>Open the EXE file and you should have a window pop-up for a split second. That's your program running and then immediately
		quitting, because after the Hello World! statement, the program ends. But if you sent that to Shaun, he could open it, and usually see the 
		exact same result as you. We all know what his reaction would be: "Yeah that's exactly what I expected". Classic Shaun.
