	<h2>Creating a script</h2>
	<div class="smallSpace"></div>
	<div class="mainParagraph">
		This is a Unity tutorial on the basics of creating a script. It will not be relevant to Vanilla C# programmers.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Intro</h4>
		In order for things to happen in your game, you will probably need to encounter some C# code, <br>unless you want to download some Visual Scripting plugin for Unity,
		or use the built-in one (haven't tried it, can't form an opinion).
		<div class="imageDescription">Don't shoot the messenger! Where the messenger is me!</div>

		<br><br>Anyway, when you are programming your game in Unity, you will <i>need</i> to use C#. It used to be a mix of JavaScript and C#, but those days are over now.
		I am here to help you learn the C# that you need.
		<br><br>And the first place to start is the intro to C#! So go to <a href="/tutorial/csharp-basics-intro.html">this lovely website</a> (just everyone's favourite, ejgames.co.uk)
		and follow that tutorial.


		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Preparation</h4>


		Hopefully by now you should have learnt the basics of C# (whether it's on my website or another) and also you should have a blank Unity project.
		<br>Unless you don't have Unity! Then install that and create a new 2D project, which is what I am using.


		<br><br>Then, add a GameObject into your scene. Either right click in the hierarchy tab and select "2D Object &#x2192 Sprites &#x2192 Square" or select the "GameObject" option
		at the top of the screen and follow the same steps.
		<img src="/tutorial/images/createscript-scenesquare.PNG" class="half-right image-zoom">
		<br><br>You should see something like this in the centre of your screen:
		<br>(Don't worry if it's not exactly the same. For example, if you just see a square on a blueish background, switch to the "Scene" tab above it)
		<div class="clear"></div>
		That is pretty much all you will need to prepare for making a script. Any GameObject will do.


		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Post-note</h4>
		This is a long tutorial, by my standards.
		<br><br>If you don't understand, you have three choices:
		<ol>
			<li>Read it again (good if this is your first time)</li>
			<li>Try a different tutorial (might be a good idea if this isn't your first time)</li>
			<li>Give up and delete C# and everything to do with it, and clear your browser history and all that malarkey (if you really want to)</li>
		</ol>
