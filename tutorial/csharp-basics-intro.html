		This is the first C# tutorial in a series on EJGames: C# Basics.
		<br>(Note: in order to program in C#, you will need a text editor (preferably Visual Studio of some sort) and the Microsoft .NET framework, which just allows C# to run.)
		<br><br>In this tutorial, I'll try to explain (in as simple a way as possible) the basics of C#.
		<br>You know W3schools? You've probably heard of it in your C# journey. I'll basically be following the same topics as that, but I'll try my best to explain it, rather
		than just give you the information. W3schools is very useful for the basic facts.

		<h4>How C# works</h4>
		C# is a compiled programming language, meaning the code you write is converted into machine language that the computer runs. If that doesn't make sense, then just
		think of it as if the computer speaks Arabic, and you only know English, so you write in English. Once you've finished your writing, the computer translates it into Arabic.
		Just imagine that, but instead of Arabic, it's binary.
		<br><br>That bit above isn't all that important. It's just some extra-fun theory.
		<br><br>When you write a C# program, in order for your code to run, you need to have:
		<ul>
			<li>A class (we'll cover that later) with the same name as the C# file,</li>
			<li>and a function (or 'method') called <span class="code">Main</span> (you can't change the name of it, otherwise it won't run by itself)</li>
		</ul>
		When you press the Run button on your code editor, or press F5, or whatever you do to run the code, C# (well, not actually the language itself but who cares) will look
		for a function called <span class="code">Main()</span>, and will execute (run) the code inside it.
		<br><br>If you've used Unity, and are programming in vanilla C#, then the <span class="code">Main()</span> is the equivalent of <span class="code">Start()</span>, pretty much.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Variables</h4>
		If you've programmed before, or been taught how to program, then you no doubt know what these are.
		<br>Especially if you learnt it from a school, then you'll also hate having to explain what it is. It's really weirdly difficult to explain. It's just a thing that you assign
		a value to, OK?
		<br><br>But, because this is a formal, no-nonsense tutorial, I have to formally explain what they are, with no nonsense at all.
		<br><br>A variable is an object that can be changed at runtime (when the program is running) that is given a name (identifier) and value.
		<br>A variable can be called anything, apart from reserved words, like <span class="code">if</span> and <span class="code">void</span> and <span class="code">using</span> and
		other keywords like that.
		<br><br>Because this a C# tutorial, not an Arabic tutorial, we create variables like this: <span class="code">var variable = value;</span>
		<br>As my Computing teacher once said, "your company will always give you a naming convention." But most of the time, you just call your variable myName. It's standard for most languages.
		<br><br>
		<div class="disclaimerBG"><b>Stop!</b>Stop right there, you silly pedantic individual that goes to small websites to make fun of their tiny mistakes! I'm probably wrong about the naming convention
		thing, but you know what? I don't care. It's not the end of the world if everyone puts helloWorld instead of hello_world or helloworld or hello%20world</div>
		<br>Thanks for keeping on reading, and not being pedantic.
		<br>Anyway, to store a variable on whether the user has logged in or not, a good name would be <span class="code">loggedIn</span>, so you would write:
		<br><span class="code">var loggedIn = false;</span>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Datatypes</h4>
		If you've come from JavaScript, or some other language that uses <span class="code">var</span>, then you will recognise the word.
		<br>If you don't, and you've got here by looking up the best programming languages and realising that C# is quite high up, then all you might know is that <span class="code">var</span>
		is short for variable.
		<br><br>There are lots of different 'datatypes' in C#. String, integer (whole number), float (decimal number), boolean (true/false), date/time, and so on.
		<br>I was deliberately using 'var' above to not confuse any new programmers. A new programmer would probably wonder what 'bool' is.
		<br>If that's you, it's absolutely fine. Bool is short for boolean.
		<br><br>If you want to create a variable with a specific datatype, you can write:
		<br>
		<div class="code"><b>int</b> number = 4;</div>
		<br><br>
		Here's a lovely table to show you a delicious sample of datatypes.
		<br><br>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Data type</th><th>Meaning</th><th>C# syntax</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Integer</td> <td>Whole number</td><td>int</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Floating point number</td> <td>Decimal number</td><td>float</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Boolean</td> <td>True/false</td><td>bool</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>String</td> <td>A piece of text</td><td>string</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Array</td> <td>A list of datatypes</td><td>datatype[]</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h4>Functions</h4>
		You know the <span class="code">Main(string[] args)</span> thing above? Let's try and remember the distant events of the mysterious past...
		<div style="font-family: Fredoka, sans-serif; color: #ccfffa;">
			<br>When you write a C# program, in order for your code to run, you need to have:
			<ul>
				<li>A class (we'll cover that later) with the same name as the C# file,</li>
				<b><li>and a function (or 'method') called <span class="code">Main</span></b> (you can't change the name of it, otherwise it won't run by itself)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		I said that <span class="code">Main</span> is a function.
		<br><br>
		But...
		<br>
		<b>What is a function?</b>
		<br><br>
		It's simple. Imagine you want to go to the shops and buy your food shopping.
		<br>You wouldn't want to repeat multiple steps over and over again.
		<br><br>For example, take when you start your car. Instead of performing the car-starting multiple times, you can just create a function, let's call it <span class="code">StartCar</span>,
		and invoke (call) it multiple times.
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
public class Example
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		StartCar();
		// Then go to the shops, and once you're finished:
		StartCar();
		// And drive home.
	}

	static void StartCar()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("The car is now on!");
		// Extra car-starting fun goes here!
	}
}
</pre>
		</div>
		Instead of repeatedly running:
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
Console.WriteLine("The car is now on!");
// Extra car-starting fun goes here!
</pre>
		</div>
		you can just call <span class="code">StartCar()</span> every time you want the car to start.
		<br><br>
		Now that the reason for creating functions is clearer, we can now dive deeper into the more advanced stuff.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Function parameters</h4>
		Say you've got your car starting logic. Which you do.
		<br>How about actually doing the shopping? That would be useful for a shopping program.
		<br><br>In order to do that efficiently, you should use parameters. They are objects that you 'pass' to a function that change how it runs. It's like a variable,
		but each time you call the function, you give it a different value.
		<br><br>
		It's done like this:
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
public class Example
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		BuyItem("Ice cream cone 4pk £3.49 on sale");
	}

	static void BuyItem(string itemName)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("You've bought " + itemName);
	}
}
</pre>
		</div>
		The output would be:
		<br><span class="code">> You've bought Ice cream cone 4pk £3.49 on sale</span>
		<br><br>
		<redBG>
			<b>Warning:</b>The parameter that you pass to the function is not accessible outside of it. You can not get the value of <span class="code">itemName</span> when you're
			not in the <span class="code">BuyItem</span> function.
		</redBG>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Overloading</h4>
		A lot of people would argue that overloading isn't necessary at this point, but it's a very useful thing to know, and since we're already covering functions, we may as well
		cover this as well.
		<br><br><b>Overloading is when you have two functions with the same name that take different parameters and can perform different actions.</b>
		<br><br>If you want to have a <span class="code">BuyItem</span> function that also takes an integer, holding the value of how many you want to buy, then you could just
		make a new function. Or, you could copy <span class="code">BuyItem</span> and add an int parameter to it.
		<br><br>Observe:
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
public class Example
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		BuyItem("Ice cream cone 4pk £3.49 on sale");
		BuyItem("Chocolate bar £0.49 on sale", 5); // Because they're on sale! Buy 5 of them!
	}

	static void BuyItem(string itemName)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("You've bought " + itemName);
	}
	
	static void BuyItem(string itemName, int amount)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("You've bought " + amount.ToString() + " of " + itemName);
	}
}
</pre>
		</div>
		The output would be:
		<br><span class="code">> You've bought Ice cream cone 4pk £3.49 on sale
			<br>> You've bought 5 of Chocolate bar £0.49 on sale
		</span>
		<br><br>It's as simple as that. If that's not simple, then... well, it might not be, because I haven't explained it very well.

		<h4>Post-note</h4>
		This is a long tutorial, by my standards.
		<br><br>If you don't understand, you have three choices:
		<ol>
			<li>Read it again (good if this is your first time)</li>
			<li>Try a different tutorial (might be a good idea if this isn't your first time)</li>
			<li>Give up and delete C# and everything to do with it, and clear your browser history and all that malarkey (if you really want to)</li>
		</ol>
