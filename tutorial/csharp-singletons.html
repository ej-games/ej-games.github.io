		This is a C# (with references to Unity) tutorial about <b>singletons</b>. This means that it will be able to be followed in vanilla C#, but will also contain context for Unity users.

		<h4>What is a singleton?</h4>
		

		Described by my good friend Moo-Juice from stackoverflow.com, they are just a pain in the bum: glorified global variable containers.
		<br>Apparently it's bad practice to use a Singleton, for some reasons involving smells and weird life cycles (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/138012">no, really</a>).
		But I generally think that unless it is going to be a big performance problem or headache, then there is no such thing as bad practice.
		<br><br>It might be useful for you to know what a singleton is, especially if you've just come from my <a href="csharp-static.html">static tutorial</a>.
		<br><br>So, let us begin with this lovely tutorial.

		<h5>The actual thing</h5>
		Yes, I have written a very rambly paragraph about practices and things, but here you go.
		<br>A singleton is a class that has one instance (like a static class) and contains lots of general-purpose, widely-used functions and variables. Alternatively, they are used
		to represent a specific mechanic or feature of a program. So you would probably have a singleton for managing music in a game, or managing sound, or something like that.
		<br>Basically, if the class "manages" something, it is probably a singleton.


		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>How do you make one?</h4>


		Classes can be singletons right out of the box, if you want to treat it like one.
		<br>This scenario below involves a singleton:
<pre><code>public class MusicManager
{
	public string musicPlaying;

	public void PlaySong(string song)
	{
		musicPlaying = song;
	}
}

class Program
{
	MusicManager musicManager;
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		musicManager = new MusicManager();

		musicManager.PlaySong("Cruising Along");
	}
}
</code></pre>
		That's just a normal class, isn't it? That's because singletons aren't a specific type of class, they are just a way to treat a class. There is no C# keyword for "Singleton".


		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Ways to make a singleton</h4>


		Yeah, yeah, I get it, less ideas and more examples, I know.
		<br><br>As I said above, there is no specific way to make a singleton, but there are some common ways.
		<br>Apart from the one above, I think there are two main ways to make one, as well as another bonus third one:

		<h5>Number 1 - The Instance Method</h5>
		All you have to do is make a static variable that refers to an instance of the class, so that you can access the instance from a static method.
		<br>What does that mean? I'm not going to tell you, but I will show you:
<pre><code>public class Singleton
{
	public static Singleton instance;
	public int favouriteNumber;

	public static void SetFavouriteNumber(int number)
	{
		instance.favouriteNumber = number;
	}
}
</code></pre>
		This will work just fine when you compile it, but when you run it, that's when the trouble starts. Whenever you call <code>Singleton.SetFavouriteNumber()</code>,
		you will get an error, because <code>instance</code> won't exist yet. You will have to do
<pre><code>static void Main(string[] args)
{
	Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
}
</code></pre>
		before anything will work.
		<br><br>Unless you're using Unity, in which case it gets a lot easier:
<pre><code>public class Singleton : MonoBehaviour
{
	public static Singleton instance;
	public int favouriteNumber;

	void Start()
	{
		instance = this;
	}

	public void SetFavouriteNumber(int number)
	{
		favouriteNumber = number;
	}
}
</code></pre>

		<h5>Number 2 - The Static Method</h5>
		I'm not sure if a static class still counts as a Singleton, but who cares?
		<br><br>This is how you would use a static class:
<pre><code>public static class Singleton
{
	public static int favouriteNumber;

	public static void SetFavouriteNumber(int number)
	{
		favouriteNumber = number;
	}
}
</code></pre>
		The class doesn't necessarily need to be static, but if it is, everything inside it has to be static as well.

		<h5>Number 3 - The Inheritance Method</h5>

		Why make a class that has to be initialised, if you can just initialise it when it is first needed?
		<br>Just make a new class that your Singleton will inherit from, and add a static variable called "instance" (just like Method 1) and then do some
		extra-fun code with it.
<pre><code>public class Singleton&lt;T&gt; where T : class, new()
{
	public static T instance
	{
		get
		{
			if(_instance == null)
				_instance = new T();

			return _instance;
		}
	};

	private static T _instance;
}

public class NumberManager : Singleton&lt;MusicManager&gt;
{
	public int favouriteNumber;

	public void SetFavouriteNumber(int number)
	{
		favouriteNumber = number;
	}
}
</code></pre>

		<h5>Note</h5>

		If you want to access a Singleton that is using the Instance or Inheritance method, just do:
<pre><code>class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		Singleton.instance.SetFavouriteNumber(666); // Oooooh
	}
}
</code></pre>

		Yet another tutorial where I do something controversial.
