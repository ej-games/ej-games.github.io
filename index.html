		<h4 id="lockedin">Stickman Multiplayer (on pause)</h4>
		<i>I'm not sure if this will ever be taken off pause.</i>
		<br><br>
		This is a multiplayer game that I'm <b>currently</b> working on, using Unity's NetCode multiplayer solution.
		<br>Trust me, it's been a fun ride.
		<br><br>
		...they made me copy and paste stuff about Relay... and Transports... and... Async Tasks ðŸ¤®
		<br><br>As of writing this, I'm only a couple of days in, and <b>all</b> I've done is:
		<ol>
			<li>Make a player that moves</li>
			<li>Nice animations for movement and jumping</li>
			<li>A block that appears (on all clients) when you go past a certain point</li>
		</ol>
		Although, I have to say a massive thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHM37DnT_QGJT5Zyl4EmqcA">Dilmer Valecillos</a> for posting a massive
		tutorial on how to create an entire multiplayer game. I used all of it. Apart from the part about VR or something.

		<div class="moveIn">
			I'm EJGames.
			<br>
			Thanks for reading.
			<br><br>I'm a programmer. I have made many games in the past, and a couple of Python utility apps. And a website (this one you're looking at right now).
			<br>I started developing games in early 2020, and, well, let's just say I've learnt a lot since.

			<h4>Locked In</h4>
			<img src="files/locked-in-card.png">
			This is a top-down shooter that I'm currently working on. I started it in November(ish) 2021, and it's still going (as of March 2022)! In Locked In, you collect coins, fight enemies,
			and complete quests (soon to be added).

			<img src="https://bit.ly/3IDX8lS" class="cardIcon" width="5px">
			<h4>ConnectCircle (Old)</h4>
			<img src="files/connect-circle-card.png">
			This is a mobile game I made (surpise: using Unity) where you tap different coloured circles to get points. I even added reward ads to the game, and could get $0.10! But
			I need to get at least $100 to redeem it.
		</div>
		<div class="moveIn card" onclick="window.location.href='installs.html#connect-more-apk'">
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3IDX8lS" class="cardIcon" width="5px">
			<h4>ConnectMore (Old)</h4>
			<img src="files/connect-more-card.png">
			This is another mobile game, but this time, you are dragging around a box to form patterns. This was my first proper mobile game I ever made, and it's available
			for Android only (because iOS is a pain).

			<h4>Obby Showdown</h4>
			<img src="files/obby-showdown-card.png">
			This is a roblox game I made! You have a controller, who places stages of parkour for the others to complete. If everyone dies, the controller wins. If the time
			runs out, the remaining runners win. Wow! I spent August 2021 making this amazing game!

			<h4>Apolycalypse (Old)</h4>
			<img src="files/apolycalypse-card.png">
			This was an FPS (first-person shooter) game that I made in Summer 2021. Let's face it: it didn't look great. But still, it was 3D, and kind of had a story, but
			I gave up before finishing the 3rd part of the story.

			<h4>3D Quiz V2 (Old)</h4>
			<img src="files/3d-quiz-v2-card.PNG">
			So, I basically got a bunch of pre-made graphics and glued them together with coding. It was a more advanced version of 3D Quiz, which was the
			first game I made! It had random questions, data saving, and more!

			<h4>Gun Mayhem! (BETA)</h4>
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3wEEg3Q">
			Oh, I tried. Who'd have thought people would prefer washing cars to shooting people? I made a Roblox FPS game, and people would rather ride a cart around
			a used car battery!? Which was actually quite good.

		<div class="moveIn card" onclick="window.location.href=String.raw`https://www.roblox.com/games/6217314637/Epic-Gun-Battle`">

			<h4>Epic Gun Battle!</h4>
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3qEeWal">
			This was the pinnacle of my entire programming career. You know why? Because I didn't write a single line of code. Or, at least I don't think I did. You were
			basically using Roblox default guns to fight each other.

			<img src="https://bit.ly/3wDn4LS" class="cardIcon">
			<h4>Practise Basic Obby Skills</h4>
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3iymA1z">
			I tried to get people to play a game called that? 'Ah, what are you playing? Looks like fun!' 'Yeah, just playing Practise Basic Obby Skills, want to join?'
			It was a typical Roblox obby game that I branded as a 'practise' place.

			<h4>Don't Think Of (Old)</h4>
			<img src="files/dont-think-of-card.PNG">
			A mobile game involving numbers. This was one of the first games I ever made. I've also tried to remake it in JavaScript, but it went horribly, and it kept crashing, and you
			kept getting +5.321876, and +Infinity, and +NaN

			<h4>Generic Platformer (Old)</h4>
			<img src="files/platformer-card.PNG">
			This was the second proper game that I ever made, and it's much better than the first game. There were 10 levels, and some of them had checkpoints! I also
			added a changelog, for some reason, as if anyone was going to read it.

			<h4>3D Quiz (Very Old)</h4>
			<img src="ejgames logo.png">
			I don't have a screenshot for this. Have my logo.
			<br>This 3D Quiz was very linear and simple, but did teach me the basics of Unity. It was a humble beginning. It was also very easy because
			the answers were always in the same place.

		In case you're not here for Locked In, then congratulations! You're a unique individual! Why don't I introduce myself, so that you don't think that you'll download a virus?
		<br>
		<span class="imageDescription">What? Who said anything about a virus?</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		Anyway, here's some background.
		<br>
		<h3>My stuff</h3>
		I have made plenty of games over the years. And other things. <b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Kinesis887/">Check out my scratch profile!!!!</a></b>
		<br>Anyway, about the games. I have made plenty of games over the years. Some successful. A lot of them... not so successful.
		<br>I'll give you a tour of the games I've made in the past. Most of them are pretty bad. But still, that's the essence of learning, isn't it?
		<h5 id="apolycalypse">Apolycalypse (Codename: FPS PVE)</h5>
		The FPS game that never got finished. Not just because of the really bad graphics (it was 3D! Do you expect me to know how to 3D model?), or the gripping narrative
		(the man tells you to kill zombies). It was just because I had another idea. Which came next:
		<h5 id="obbyshowdown">Obby Showdown (on Roblox)</h5>
		Ah, you thought I would never branch out and make games outside of Unity? Well you were wrong! My amazing <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7243771257/">Roblox game</a> got
		barely any players, and also broke after I left it and came back. Although, the idea behind the game was absolutely amazing. People were completing the obstacle course, while a 'controller'
		added stages, in real time. Sick. Even after all that effort, I got barely any reward.
		Just goes to show how hard work doesn't always lead to success. Unless...
		<h5 id="connectmore">ConnectMore</h5>
		To be honest, it was my first mobile game that
		<ol>
			<li>Looked decent</li>
			<li>Was 'weirdly addicting'</li>
			<li>Had quite a lot of content.</li>
		</ol>
		You moved a square, and then it attached to other squares, and you had to build patterns out of the squares. It was a pretty good game. I even added skins, and a pattern viewer,
		using my newly learnt knowledge of <span class="code">Resources.Load()</span> in Unity. And, also, that was when I finally realised the architecture of Unity games. How did I
		only just realise what <span class="code">static</span> actually meant?
		<h5>Skip a few... ConnectCircle... Look Over There... Weird Circle Rotate Thingy... uhhhh</h5>
		<h5 id="lockedininfo">Locked In</h5>
		And here we are now. Making a super cool PC game, top down, 2D, and over-engineering a website for it. Come on, making a website is fun! Especially when you're not just using Notepad.

		<h4><a href="https://tzgames.github.io/" class="URLbuttonText zoomonhover">TZGames</a></h4>
		I am so happy to announce that TZGames... exists! It's here! Look at it! You'll find some epic stuff like:
		<ul>
			<li>A calendar (as of writing, <i>Schedule/Organiser</i> is just a calendar)</li>
			<li>A Unity tutorial (as of writing, there's only one)</li>
			<li>Astro Hole (as of writing, it's still in early development, and doesn't look like it will be finished any time soon, but still go and support it)</li>
			<li>A copy of my search bar!</li>
