		<h4 id="lockedin">Stickman Multiplayer (on pause)</h4>
		<i>I'm not sure if this will ever be taken off pause.</i>
		<br><br>
		This is a multiplayer game that I'm <b>currently</b> working on, using Unity's NetCode multiplayer solution.
		<br>Trust me, it's been a fun ride.
		<br><br>
		...they made me copy and paste stuff about Relay... and Transports... and... Async Tasks ðŸ¤®
		<br><br>As of writing this, I'm only a couple of days in, and <b>all</b> I've done is:
		<ol>
			<li>Make a player that moves</li>
			<li>Nice animations for movement and jumping</li>
			<li>A block that appears (on all clients) when you go past a certain point</li>
		</ol>
		Although, I have to say a massive thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHM37DnT_QGJT5Zyl4EmqcA">Dilmer Valecillos</a> for posting a massive
		tutorial on how to create an entire multiplayer game. I used all of it. Apart from the part about VR or something.

		In case you're not here for Locked In, then congratulations! You're a unique individual! Why don't I introduce myself, so that you don't think that you'll download a virus?

		Anyway, here's some background.
		<br>
		<h3>My stuff</h3>
		I have made plenty of games over the years. And other things. <b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/YouSawMyWebsiteLol/">Check out my scratch profile!!!!</a></b>
		<br>Anyway, about the games. I have made plenty of games over the years. Some successful. A lot of them... not so successful.
		<br>I'll give you a tour of the games I've made in the past. Most of them are pretty bad. But still, that's the essence of learning, isn't it?
		<h5 id="apolycalypse">Apolycalypse (Codename: FPS PVE)</h5>
		The FPS game that never got finished. Not just because of the really bad graphics (it was 3D! Do you expect me to know how to 3D model?), or the gripping narrative
		(the man tells you to kill zombies). It was just because I had another idea. Which came next:
		<h5 id="obbyshowdown">Obby Showdown (on Roblox)</h5>
		Ah, you thought I would never branch out and make games outside of Unity? Well you were wrong! My amazing <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7243771257/">Roblox game</a> got
		barely any players, and also broke after I left it and came back. Although, the idea behind the game was absolutely amazing. People were completing the obstacle course, while a 'controller'
		added stages, in real time. Sick. Even after all that effort, I got barely any reward.
		Just goes to show how hard work doesn't always lead to success. Unless...
		<h5 id="connectmore">ConnectMore</h5>
		To be honest, it was my first mobile game that
		<ol>
			<li>Looked decent</li>
			<li>Was 'weirdly addicting'</li>
			<li>Had quite a lot of content.</li>
		</ol>
		You moved a square, and then it attached to other squares, and you had to build patterns out of the squares. It was a pretty good game. I even added skins, and a pattern viewer,
		using my newly learnt knowledge of <span class="code">Resources.Load()</span> in Unity. And, also, that was when I finally realised the architecture of Unity games. How did I
		only just realise what <span class="code">static</span> actually meant?
		<h5>Skip a few... ConnectCircle... Look Over There... Weird Circle Rotate Thingy... uhhhh</h5>
		<h5 id="lockedininfo">Locked In</h5>
		And here we are now. Making a super cool PC game, top down, 2D, and over-engineering a website for it. Come on, making a website is fun! Especially when you're not just using Notepad.
