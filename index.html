		<i>I'm not sure if this will ever be taken off pause.</i>
		<br><br>
		This is a multiplayer game that I'm <b>currently</b> working on, using Unity's NetCode multiplayer solution.
		<br>Trust me, it's been a fun ride.
		<br><br>
		...they made me copy and paste stuff about Relay... and Transports... and... Async Tasks ðŸ¤®
		<br><br>As of writing this, I'm only a couple of days in, and <b>all</b> I've done is:
		<ol>
			<li>Make a player that moves</li>
			<li>Nice animations for movement and jumping</li>
			<li>A block that appears (on all clients) when you go past a certain point</li>
		</ol>
		Although, I have to say a massive thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHM37DnT_QGJT5Zyl4EmqcA">Dilmer Valecillos</a> for posting a massive
		tutorial on how to create an entire multiplayer game. I used all of it. Apart from the part about VR or something.

		<div class="moveIn">
			I'm EJGames.
			<br>
			Thanks for reading.
			<br><br>I'm a programmer. I have made many games in the past, and a couple of Python utility apps. And a website (this one you're looking at right now).
			<br>I started developing games in early 2020, and, well, let's just say I've learnt a lot since.

			<h4>Locked In</h4>
			<img src="images/c-lockedin-card.jpg">
			This is a top-down shooter that I'm currently working on. I started it in November(ish) 2021, and it's still going (as of March 2022)! In Locked In, you collect coins, fight enemies,
			kill bosses, upgrade your weapons, explore new zones, do other things, and some other things, and complete quests (soon to be added).

			<h4>Parkour Game</h4>
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3v3u7LF">
			I'm making a new Roblox game? Yes, and it's going to be quite bad, seeing as I haven't even touched Roblox for a few months. It's going to be a simple parkour game, like
			<a href="#pbos">Practise Basic Obby Skills</a>, but a bit more simple, and not called Practise Basic Obby Skills.

			<h4>ConnectCircle</h4>
			<img src="images/c-connectcircle-card.jpg">
			This is a mobile game I made (surpise: using Unity) where you tap different coloured circles to get points. I even added reward ads to the game, and could get $0.10! But
			I need to get at least $100 to redeem it. It has speed upgrades, money upgrades, and even prestiging. And it's available for Android!

			<h4>ConnectMore</h4>
			<img src="images/c-connectmore-card.jpg">
			This is another mobile game, but this time, you are dragging around a box to form patterns. You get points for forming different patterns, with more complex patterns
			rewarding more points. It has skins, a pattern viewer and, for some reason, a button to reset your data. It's also available for Android!

			<h4>Obby Showdown</h4>
			<img src="images/c-obbyshowdown-card.jpg">
			This is a roblox game I made! You have a controller, who places stages of parkour for the others to complete. If everyone dies, the controller wins. If the time
			runs out, the remaining runners win. I spent August 2021 making this amazing game! I didn't know, at the time, that it would be the last Roblox game I ever made,
			for now, at least.

			<h4>Apolycalypse</h4>
			<img src="images/c-apolycalypse-card.png">
			This was an FPS (first-person shooter) game that I made in Summer 2021. Let's face it: it didn't look great, and the story wasn't very gripping. It also had a ton of bugs!
			Go on, try and find all of them! I've counted 53, try and find them all! Go on, download it by visiting the installs page!

			<h4>3D Quiz V2</h4>
			<img src="images/c-3dquiz-card.png">
			So, I basically got a bunch of pre-made graphics and glued them together with coding. It was a more advanced version of 3D Quiz, which was the
			first game I made! This version has random questions, a new 'notification' system (what's a 'notification?'), and data saving, and XP, and levels, but not much else.

			<h4>Gun Mayhem! (BETA)</h4>
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3wEEg3Q">
			This was an FPS game that I made in May 2021 that was actually really good! Until I stopped making it, came back, and realised it's nothing compared to
			most Roblox games. Still, it was very fun to play, but apparently, washing cars is more fun. And riding around a used car battery.

			<h4>Epic Gun Battle!</h4>
			<img src="https://bit.ly/3qEeWal">
			This was the pinnacle of my entire programming career. You know why? Because I didn't write a single line of code. Or, at least I don't think I did. You were
			basically using Roblox default guns to fight each other. And there was a label in the top left that says 'Level XX' because I had yet to add levels and XP into the game.

			I tried to get people to play a game called that? 'Ah, what are you playing? Looks like fun!' 'Yeah, just playing Practise Basic Obby Skills, want to join?'
			It was a typical Roblox obby game that I branded as a 'practise' place. And we don't even talk about Roblox here.

			A mobile game involving numbers. This was one of the first games I ever made. I've also tried to remake it in JavaScript, but it went horribly, and it kept crashing, and you
			kept getting +5.321876, and +Infinity, and +NaN.

			This was the second proper game that I ever made, and it's much better than the first game. There were 10 levels, and some of them had checkpoints! I also
			added a changelog, for some reason, as if anyone was going to read it.

			I don't have a screenshot for this. Have my logo.
			<br>This 3D Quiz was very linear and simple, but did teach me the basics of Unity. It was a humble beginning. It was also very easy because
			the answers were always in the same place.

		In case you're not here for Locked In, then congratulations! You're a unique individual! Why don't I introduce myself, so that you don't think that you'll download a virus?
		<br>
		<span class="imageDescription">What? Who said anything about a virus?</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		Anyway, here's some background.
		<br>
		<h3>My stuff</h3>
		I have made plenty of games over the years. And other things. <b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Kinesis887/">Check out my scratch profile!!!!</a></b>
		<br>Anyway, about the games. I have made plenty of games over the years. Some successful. A lot of them... not so successful.
		<br>I'll give you a tour of the games I've made in the past. Most of them are pretty bad. But still, that's the essence of learning, isn't it?
		<h5 id="apolycalypse">Apolycalypse (Codename: FPS PVE)</h5>
		The FPS game that never got finished. Not just because of the really bad graphics (it was 3D! Do you expect me to know how to 3D model?), or the gripping narrative
		(the man tells you to kill zombies). It was just because I had another idea. Which came next:
		<h5 id="obbyshowdown">Obby Showdown (on Roblox)</h5>
		Ah, you thought I would never branch out and make games outside of Unity? Well you were wrong! My amazing <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7243771257/">Roblox game</a> got
		barely any players, and also broke after I left it and came back. Although, the idea behind the game was absolutely amazing. People were completing the obstacle course, while a 'controller'
		added stages, in real time. Sick. Even after all that effort, I got barely any reward.
		Just goes to show how hard work doesn't always lead to success. Unless...
		<h5 id="connectmore">ConnectMore</h5>
		To be honest, it was my first mobile game that
		<ol>
			<li>Looked decent</li>
			<li>Was 'weirdly addicting'</li>
			<li>Had quite a lot of content.</li>
		</ol>
		You moved a square, and then it attached to other squares, and you had to build patterns out of the squares. It was a pretty good game. I even added skins, and a pattern viewer,
		using my newly learnt knowledge of <span class="code">Resources.Load()</span> in Unity. And, also, that was when I finally realised the architecture of Unity games. How did I
		only just realise what <span class="code">static</span> actually meant?
		<h5>Skip a few... ConnectCircle... Look Over There... Weird Circle Rotate Thingy... uhhhh</h5>
		<h5 id="lockedininfo">Locked In</h5>
		And here we are now. Making a super cool PC game, top down, 2D, and over-engineering a website for it. Come on, making a website is fun! Especially when you're not just using Notepad.

		I am so happy to announce that TZGames... exists! It's here! Look at it! You'll find some epic stuff like:
		<ul>
			<li>A calendar (as of writing, <i>Schedule/Organiser</i> is just a calendar)</li>
			<li>A Unity tutorial (as of writing, there's only one)</li>
			<li>Astro Hole (as of writing, it's still in early development, and doesn't look like it will be finished any time soon, but still go and support it)</li>
			<li>A copy of my search bar!</li>
