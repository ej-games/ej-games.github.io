	<h2>Locked In Changelog</h2>
	<div class="mainParagraph">
		<div class="smallSpace"></div>
		These are all the updates made to Locked In so far.<br><br>
		<button type="button" class="buttonURL" id="keyButton" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('updateKey', 'keyButton')">Show
			info</button> about update types
		<br>
		<span id="updateKey" style="display: none;">
			<ul>
				<li>Feature update: adds new features, like, for example, classes (added in Alpha V4) and bosses (added
					in Alpha V3). Alpha V4 is a feature update.</li>
				<li>Content update: adds new content, like more guns, bosses and sections. Alpha V3 and V5 are content updates.
				</li>
				<li>Fix update: fixes major bugs, or just a lot of bugs. Expect more of these in the future. Alpha V6
					is a fix update.</li>
				<li>Pre-update: before a proper update is released, Locked In will have a "pre-update" (named something
					like "V4-P"), which just allows for people to play the game with the new update, and report bugs,
					and have them fixed in the next update.</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
		</span>
		<h3 class="moveIn">V6-P - Pre-Fix Update</h3>
		<div class="line moveIn"></div>
		<h4 id="v6-note" class="moveIn">Note</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			We've got the same disclaimer as last update - there are no NPCs this time, unfortunately. We're still working (very slowly, but still) on the main NPC (John Gold)
			and his quests. The story will be finished! I will not be happy with this game until the story is done. And I know this sounds like the story of someone who's lost
			all motivation. If I had, then this update wouldn't be here!
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v6-boss" class="moveIn">New Boss: Corrupted Heart</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			We've added a new boss! Unfortunately, it's not a conga line of robots. But it's another boss, instead of just having one.
			<br>It's a corrupted heart, and it spawns rounds of enemies, as well as other enemies spawning more quickly.
			<br>Killing it won't give you any special rewards, but will give you a lot of coins.
			<br><br>Try and find it, and slay it for its gold!
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		
		<h4 id="v6-sounds" class="moveIn">Changes to Sounds</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			Let's admit it: the previous sound design for Locked In was quite lackluster.
			<br>So, to change it, we've added:
			<h5 class="moveIn">3D Sound</h5>
			<div class="moveIn">
				Instead of being flat and boring, we've changed the sounds so they change volume depending on distance, and are directional! This means that both of your ears
				can hear different things, making the game even more sickening.
			</div>
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<h5 class="moveIn">Footstep Sounds</h5>
			<div class="moveIn">
				Footstep sounds now play for the player (as well as a very subtle walking animation that is just the player getting bigger and smaller). We wanted to add this
				because otherwise, between fights with enemies, it's just dead silence. Which is eerie, but boring. Instead, the footstep sounds make it seem lonelier. Because you are lonely.
			</div>
			<h5 class="moveIn">Louder Music</h5>
			<div class="moveIn">
				The music is a lot louder now, especially in boss fights, because before, you couldn't hear it over the shooting.
			</div>
			<h5 class="moveIn">Enemy Sounds</h5>
			<div class="moveIn">
				Another thing that helps with boring emptiness is ambient sound! Enemies now will give off a random, appropriate sound (meaning a zombie won't make the sound of a gun shooting).
			</div>
			<h5 class="moveIn">UI Sounds</h5>
			<div class="moveIn">
				There are new UI sounds for when you press most buttons, as well as hovering over them.
			</div>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>

		<h4 id="v6-camera" class="moveIn">Camera Changes</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			The camera was also a bit of a boring aspect of the old game: now we've changed it completely to be a lot more immersive, and easier to use.
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Old camera</b></td><td><b>New camera</b></td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><red>Slow</red></td><td><green>Much faster</green></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><red>Far away</red></td><td><green>Closer</green></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><green>Can see both times</green></td><td><red>Can't see both sides</red></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><red>Unresponsive</red></td><td><green>Moves towards mouse pointer</green></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			If you're wondering why we've downgraded the range of the camera, it's because we want the game to be more immersive, just like the 3D sound changes.
			<br>It will also be good to know people respond to some more experimental changes.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>

		<h4 id="v6-menu" class="moveIn">Main Menu!</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			I can't believe we went for so long without even a menu screen!
			<br><br>In it, there are options to:
			<ul>
				<li>Play the game</li>
				<li>Change Loadout</li>
				<li>Change class (this can no longer be done in game)</li>
				<li>Change settings (which is still a mess right now)</li>
				<li>Exit the game (but we don't press that one, do we?)</li>
			</ul>
			It also has some exclusive music (the track is called 'Into the Depths') handmade by yours truly, EJGames.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>

		<h4 id="v6-tweaks" class="moveIn">Tweaks / Bug Fixes</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
			<!-- onmouseenter="stt('Quality of Life Change')" onmouseleave="htt()"-->
			<i class="fa-solid fa-award hover"><hide>Quality of life change</hide></i><b>Coins move towards you</b>
			<br>Instead of being really difficult to catch, coins will now move towards the player when they are near.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-bolt-lightning hover"><hide>Cool feature</hide></i><b>Music muffles in the menu</b>
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-bug hover"><hide>Bug fix</hide></i><b>Bug fix: Wannabee can't hit the player</b>
			<br>Before, the bee boss wouldn't be able to hit you due to the <a href="#v5-enemies">changes to how enemies attacked</a>. This has now bee-n fixed!
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-user-group hover"><hide>Suggestions</hide></i><b>Shaking has been greatly decreased</b>
			<br>Rather than being uncomfortably vigorous with the shaking, we've toned it down a bit. The guns aren't that hard to use.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-bug hover"><hide>Bug fix</hide></i><b>Enemies spawn closer</b>
			<br>Instead of spawning 50m further up, they just spawn offscreen.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-award hover"><hide>Quality of life change</hide></i><b>Dying is much more polished</b>
			<br>There is now a 'you died' screen that shows how many coins you collected, how far you travelled etc.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-desktop hover"><hide>Performance optimisation</hide></i><b>No camera in the menu</b>
			<br>It was taking up a lot of memory, and is not worth the effort of actually optimising it.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-globe hover"><hide>General update</hide></i><b>New font</b>
			<br>It's probably just me being sick of it, but I hated the old one. Also, it now matches the website. It's called "Be Vietnam Pro", for all of you
			who care about it for some reason.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-globe hover"><hide>General update</hide></i><b>Notifications are darker</b>
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-award hover"><hide>Quality of life change</hide></i><b>Notifications appear quicker</b>
			<br>It might make you jump, but at least you get the information quicker.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-award hover"><hide>Quality of life change</hide></i><b>Changed FPS counter font</b>
			<br>This was to improve readability, so that all the digits are in the same place.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-globe hover"><hide>General update</hide></i><b>New icon</b>
			<br>It's no longer just a zombie. Although it might be changed again, because it doesn't look too good when actually as small as an icon.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-bug hover"><hide>Bug fix</hide></i><b>Bug fix: enemy clusters wouldn't spawn correctly</b>
			<br>It's because I added too many zeroes to the distance from the player! Or something. But it's fixed now.
			<br><br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-globe hover"><hide>General update</hide></i><b>Music changes</b>
			<br>Added new track ('Into the Depths') and added more tracks for different zones, as well as shuffling some tracks around.

		<h3 class="v5p moveIn">V5-P - Pre-Content Update</h3>
		<div class="line moveIn"></div>
		<h4 id="v5-note" class="moveIn">Note</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We've (we being just me) been working on the storyline for the game. But because it's not finished, and we want to keep releasing updates, we've just removed NPCs for now
		and we'll add them back in once the story is finished. And then... oh, I don't know what will happen once the game is done.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v5-zones" class="moveIn">Zones</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We have biomes! But let's not call them that, because that's associated with a certain other pixel-art based game.
		<br><br>
		Right now, we've got:
		<br><br>
		<h5>Normal Zone</h5>
		Mites, zombies and robots roam this area. It's also the place that you start. But it can also appear further on.
		<h5>Frosty Zone</h5>
		Frost zombies, snowman zombies and mites are here. It's also really easy to find. Just 50 or so metres away from the start.
		<h5>Shady Zone</h5>
		Thugs! Darkness! Where have the lights gone? Why is there a car alarm in the music? Find all this and more in the <b>Shady Zone!</b> (only appears 150m in, and further).
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v5-weapons" class="moveIn">More weapon<del>s</del>!</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We've added a new weapon. There are <b>way</b> more weapons that you can unlock by killing enemies, and bosses, and completing quests, but right now, we've only added one that you can buy:
		<h5 style="font-family: Engravers MT, sans-serif;">The Streetsweeper</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Automatic Shotgun</li>
			<li>Fires around 4 rounds per second</li>
			<li>Medium spread, high damage at close range</li>
			<li>1500 coins</li>
			<li>Ingame description: <i>A fast-firing, automatic shotgun, that allows for spraying the enemies while holding down the trigger. Sure, it's not the most skillful, but it's definitely effective.</i></li>
		</ul>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v5-enemies" class="moveIn">Enemy changes</h4>
		<div class="disclaimerBG moveIn"><b>Technical alert!</b>Do you want to know about a really boring change? If not, then just skip this section. If you do, then go on, read ahead!</div>
		<br>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We've changed how enemies work to reduce the really quick kills (when enemies would just run into the player repeatedly, with no gaps inbetween hits, and kill in under a second).
		<br><br>To do this, we have <b>removed collision-based attacks</b>, and now, enemies damage the player over time, if they are in range.
		<br>This does mean that enemies can hit from a longer range. But, we have specifically set each enemy's range to a different value, that suits the enemy, so that
		not all of the enemies can snipe you from 50m away.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
	</div>
		<h4 id="v5-tweaks" class="moveIn">Tweaks! Yay!</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		Because of the very frequently asked question, "Why don't you have more tweaks in your changelogs?", I'm happy to announce that I noted down all of the changes I made
		in Locked In V5.
		<br><br><b>New cursor</b>
		<br>Added a new cursor, that looks like this: <img src="cursor-default.png" style="width: 1.5em;"> and changes based on what you're hovering over. Mainly just guns.
		<br><br><b>Light spell</b>
		<br>We've removed the 'shows the way forward' aspect of the spell for the Light class. It was just completely weird, going through walls, and for some reason, changing its mind to
		which way is forward...?
		<br><br><b>Removed lanterns on the side</b>
		<br><br><b>Teleporting into walls is no longer allowed</b>
		<br>There's just a notification telling you that you can't, and it stops you from teleporting if there's something in the way.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div><div class="smallSpace"></div>

		<h3 id="v4">V4 - Feature update</h3>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<h4 id="tweaks">Tweaks</h4>
		Top tip: don't release an update without playtesting it. Actually, we've done it right by releasing pre-feature updates. This is the first one! Here are the changes
		we've made since V4-P.
		<ul>
			<li>LMG does 1 less damage per shot (going from 17 to 16)</li>
			<li>The Wannabee weapon does more damage, as requested by some individuals</li>
			<li>The LMG has been fixed. No more 150-pellet shots. Can't believe that one made the update.</li>
			<li>Music has been changed, and returned to its former glory. The new songs (made by me, of course) are so much better than the old ones, some of which <i>weren't</i> made my me.</li>
			<li>If you've seen one of those flickering lights, you won't any more. Those were chests trying to spawn. That's been fixed.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div><div class="smallSpace"></div>
		<br>Some of the older versions are still in the old changelog format. It doesn't look too bad, though, does it?
			<h3 id="v4-p">V4-P - Pre-feature update</h3>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="classes">New feature: classes!</h4>
			Classes can be chosen by opening the main menu (escape) and choosing "Select Class".
			<br><br><img src="lockedinclasses.png" width="70%" class="centre">
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			There are currently 5 classes, each with a <i>passive</i> and a <i>spell</i>:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Frost</b>: the spell is "Frostwind" and the passive is "Cold shots"<br> <button type="button"
						class="buttonURL" id="frost-button" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('frost-info', 'frost-button')">Show

				</li>
			</ul>
			Well, that was a lot of information!
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="quests">NPCs and Quests</h4>
			Specifically a mechanic, who goes by the name... <i>John Gold</i>.
			<br><br>
			<div class="disclaimer">Disclaimer:
				<ul>
					<li>The current NPC, John Gold, only gives 1 quest, which does not have progress that can be saved.</li>
					<li>This is in order to add NPCs in Locked In V4 without having to spend even more time adding new
						quests and rewards.</li>
					<li>More quests, and possibly more NPCs, will be added in the next Content update, along with possible
						new bosses, guns and sections.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<i>Anyway</i>, the new NPC, John Gold, will give you a quest, and after the quest, he will despawn, and won't
			spawn again until you restart.<br>
			This will be changed in a future update. We've already got some stuff ready for it!
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			And don't worry. We definitely won't make it easy! What? It's not like we're going to make you kill lots of
			really rare enemies and get a very small reward? Pff. No. No way.
			<br>
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="ui">A massive UI update</h4>
			New loadout screen! Check it:
			<br><br><img src="newloadout.png" width="70%" class="centre">
			<div class="imageDescription">Isn't that just so much better than before? Remember the really ugly box
				that used to pop up to change your loadout?</div>
			<h5>New notifications!</h5>
			Simple, quick notification!
			<br>
			<br><img src="newnotification.png" width="70%"class="centre">
			<div class="imageDescription">For when you need information mid-game, like if your spell is on

			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="bugfixes">Bug fixes and tweaks</h4>
			Everyone's favourite part!
			<ul>
				<li>Wannabee will no longer disappear off the map... hopefully.</li>
				<li>Firerate of guns is no longer affected by framerate.</li>
				<li>Enemies will no longer get caught on walls.</li>
				<li>And, as always, the ones that I can't remember off the top of my head.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="postupdatenote">Post-update note</h4>
			This update is hopefully going to change the style of Locked In, turning it from a repetitive, fast paced
			shooter, to a more randomized, chaotic (but not infuriating... yet) arcade game.
			We've tried as hard as we can ('we' being me, alone) to add some more features and content to the game, as well
			as freshening up our website. If you want to support us, visit our <a
				href="https://nikelet.itch.io/lockedinalpha">itch.io page</a> and,
			after we set up donations, donate!
			<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
			<h3>V3 - Content Update</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In this update, we added bosses! Specifically a bee called Wannabee!
					<ul>
						<li>Has multiple different phases</li>
						<li>Spawns in an exclusive enemy (small bee)</li>
						<li>Gives a secret new weapon when defeated!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>New gun: LMG
					<ul>
						<li>Fires as quick as an AR</li>
						<li>Long time before lots of shake</li>
						<li>Kills pretty quickly!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>New gun: Kar98k
					<ul>
						<li>Does 150 damage in one shot</li>
						<li>Pierces enemies</li>
						<li>Takes time to aim in before shooting</li>
						<li>Kills a lot of things instantly!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>Added a few tiny changes and bug fixes
					<ul>
						<li>Your head now moves before your body and gun</li>
						<li>Added a movement counter, and darkness speed indicator</li>
						<li>The gun now goes under your head and over your arms, instead of being on top of both</li>
						<li>A few other teeny tiny ones that I can't remember off the top of my head</li>
					</ul>
