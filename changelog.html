	<h2>Locked In Changelog</h2>
	<div class="mainParagraph">
		<div class="smallSpace"></div>
		These are all the updates made to Locked In so far.<br><br>
		<button type="button" class="buttonURL" id="keyButton" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('updateKey', 'keyButton')">Show
			info</button> about update types
		<br>
		<span id="updateKey" style="display: none;">
			<ul>
				<li>Feature update: adds new features, like, for example, classes (added in Alpha V4) and bosses (added
					in Alpha V3). Alpha V4 is a feature update.</li>
				<li>Content update: adds new content, like more guns, bosses and sections. Alpha V3 is a feature update.
				</li>
				<li>Fix update: fixes major bugs, or just a lot of bugs. Expect more of these in the future. Alpha V2
					could be classed as a fix update.</li>
				<li>Pre-update: before a proper update is released, Locked In will have a "pre-update" (named something
					like "Pre-V4"), which just allows for people to play the game with the new update, and report bugs,
					and have them fixed in the next update.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="v5p moveIn">V5-P - Pre-Content Update</h3>
		<div class="line moveIn"></div>
		<h4 id="v5-note" class="moveIn">Note</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We've (we being just me) been working on the storyline for the game. But because it's not finished, and we want to keep releasing updates, we've just removed NPCs for now
		and we'll add them back in once the story is finished. And then... oh, I don't know what will happen once the game is done.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v5-zones" class="moveIn">Zones</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We have biomes! But let's not call them that, because that's associated with a certain other pixel-art based game.
		<br><br>
		Right now, we've got:
		<br><br>
		<h5>Normal Zone</h5>
		Mites, zombies and robots roam this area. It's also the place that you start. But it can also appear further on.
		<h5>Frosty Zone</h5>
		Frost zombies, snowman zombies and mites are here. It's also really easy to find. Just 50 or so metres away from the start.
		<h5>Shady Zone</h5>
		Thugs! Darkness! Where have the lights gone? Why is there a car alarm in the music? Find all this and more in the <b>Shady Zone!</b> (only appears 150m in, and further).
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v5-weapons" class="moveIn">More weapon<del>s</del>!</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We've added a new weapon. There are <b>way</b> more weapons that you can unlock by killing enemies, and bosses, and completing quests, but right now, we've only added one that you can buy:
		<h5 style="font-family: Engravers MT, sans-serif;">The Streetsweeper</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Automatic Shotgun</li>
			<li>Fires around 4 rounds per second</li>
			<li>Medium spread, high damage at close range</li>
			<li>1500 coins</li>
			<li>Ingame description: <i>A fast-firing, automatic shotgun, that allows for spraying the enemies while holding down the trigger. Sure, it's not the most skillful, but it's definitely effective.</i></li>
		</ul>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		</div>
		<h4 id="v5-enemies" class="moveIn">Enemy changes</h4>
		<div class="disclaimerBG moveIn"><b>Technical alert!</b>Do you want to know about a really boring change? If not, then just skip this section. If you do, then go on, read ahead!</div>
		<br>
		<div class="moveIn">
		We've changed how enemies work to reduce the really quick kills (when enemies would just run into the player repeatedly, with no gaps inbetween hits, and kill in under a second).
		<br><br>To do this, we have <b>removed collision-based attacks</b>, and now, enemies damage the player over time, if they are in range.
		<br>This does mean that enemies can hit from a longer range. But, we have specifically set each enemy's range to a different value, that suits the enemy, so that
		not all of the enemies can snipe you from 50m away.
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
	</div>
		<h4 id="v5-tweaks" class="moveIn">Tweaks! Yay!</h4>
		<div class="moveIn">
		Because of the very frequently asked question, "Why don't you have more tweaks in your changelogs?", I'm happy to announce that I noted down all of the changes I made
		in Locked In V5.
		<br><br><b>New cursor</b>
		<br>Added a new cursor, that looks like this: <img src="cursor-default.png" style="width: 1.5em;"> and changes based on what you're hovering over. Mainly just guns.
		<br><br><b>Light spell</b>
		<br>We've removed the 'shows the way forward' aspect of the spell for the Light class. It was just completely weird, going through walls, and for some reason, changing its mind to
		which way is forward...?
		<br><br><b>Removed lanterns on the side</b>
		<br><br><b>Teleporting into walls is no longer allowed</b>
		<br>There's just a notification telling you that you can't, and it stops you from teleporting if there's something in the way.

		<h3 id="v4">V4 - Feature update</h3>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<h4 id="tweaks">Tweaks</h4>
		Top tip: don't release an update without playtesting it. Actually, we've done it right by releasing pre-feature updates. This is the first one! Here are the changes
		we've made since V4-P.
		<ul>
			<li>LMG does 1 less damage per shot (going from 17 to 16)</li>
			<li>The Wannabee weapon does more damage, as requested by some individuals</li>
			<li>The LMG has been fixed. No more 150-pellet shots. Can't believe that one made the update.</li>
			<li>Music has been changed, and returned to its former glory. The new songs (made by me, of course) are so much better than the old ones, some of which <i>weren't</i> made my me.</li>
			<li>If you've seen one of those flickering lights, you won't any more. Those were chests trying to spawn. That's been fixed.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div><div class="smallSpace"></div>
		<br>Some of the older versions are still in the old changelog format. It doesn't look too bad, though, does it?
			<h3 id="v4-p">V4-P - Pre-feature update</h3>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="classes">New feature: classes!</h4>
			Classes can be chosen by opening the main menu (escape) and choosing "Select Class".
			<br><br><img src="lockedinclasses.png" width="70%" class="centre">
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			There are currently 5 classes, each with a <i>passive</i> and a <i>spell</i>:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Frost</b>: the spell is "Frostwind" and the passive is "Cold shots"<br> <button type="button"
						class="buttonURL" id="frost-button" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('frost-info', 'frost-button')">Show
						info</button>
					<ul id="frost-info" style="display: none;">
						<li>Frostwind: "Sends a gust of wind at the enemies, knocking them back and freezing them for 5
							seconds."</li>
						<li>Cold shots: "Hitting an enemy can slow it for 5 seconds."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Fire</b>: the spell is "Firewall" and the passive is "Flaming bullets"<br> <button type="button"
						class="buttonURL" id="fire-button" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('fire-info', 'fire-button')">Show
						info</button>
					<ul id="fire-info" style="display:	none;">
						<li>Firewall: "Sends a wall of flames towards the enemies, damaging them and setting them on fire
							for 10 seconds."</li>
						<li>Flaming bullets: "Each shot has a chance of setting the enemy on fire for 5 seconds."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Magic</b>: the spell is "Teleport" and the passive is "Defence impulse"<br> <button type="button"
						class="buttonURL" id="magic-button" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('magic-info', 'magic-button')">Show
						info</button>
					<ul id="magic-info" style="display:	none;">
						<li>Teleport: "Allows instant teleportation through walls to the mouse's position."</li>
						<li>Defence impulse: "When below 25% health, a small magic impulse is sent out, dealing damage to
							all enemies in range."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Life</b>: the spell is "Heal" and the passive is "Restoration"<br> <button type="button"
						class="buttonURL" id="life-button" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('life-info', 'life-button')">Show
						info</button>
					<ul id="life-info" style="display:	none;">
						<li>Heal: "Instantly heals for half of your maximum health."</li>
						<li>Defence impulse: "Passive healing is twice as fast, and activates 25% quicker."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Light</b>: the spell is "Snapshot" and the passive is "Insight"<br> <button type="button"
						class="buttonURL" id="light-button" onclick="ShowExtraInfo('light-info', 'light-button')">Show
						info</button>
					<ul id="light-info" style="display:	none;">
						<li>Snapshot: "Reveals the direction of all enemies, and shows the way forward."</li>
						<li>Defence impulse: "The closer the darkness gets, the brighter the area."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			Well, that was a lot of information!
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="quests">NPCs and Quests</h4>
			Specifically a mechanic, who goes by the name... <i>John Gold</i>.
			<br><br>
			<div class="disclaimer">Disclaimer:
				<ul>
					<li>The current NPC, John Gold, only gives 1 quest, which does not have progress that can be saved.</li>
					<li>This is in order to add NPCs in Locked In V4 without having to spend even more time adding new
						quests and rewards.</li>
					<li>More quests, and possibly more NPCs, will be added in the next Content update, along with possible
						new bosses, guns and sections.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<i>Anyway</i>, the new NPC, John Gold, will give you a quest, and after the quest, he will despawn, and won't
			spawn again until you restart.<br>
			This will be changed in a future update. We've already got some stuff ready for it!
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			And don't worry. We definitely won't make it easy! What? It's not like we're going to make you kill lots of
			really rare enemies and get a very small reward? Pff. No. No way.
			<br>
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="ui">A massive UI update</h4>
			New loadout screen! Check it:
			<br><br><img src="newloadout.png" width="70%" class="centre">
			<div class="imageDescription">Isn't that just so much better than before? Remember the really ugly box
				that used to pop up to change your loadout?</div>
			<h5>New notifications!</h5>
			Simple, quick notification!
			<br>
			<br><img src="newnotification.png" width="70%"class="centre">
			<div class="imageDescription">For when you need information mid-game, like if your spell is on
				cooldown. It has a shake too! Wow!</div>
			<br><br>Notify popup!
			<br><br><img src="lockedinconfirm.png" width="50%">
			<div class="imageDescription">Ooh, look at you, you privileged player! Getting to choose your
				option? That's not available to some people, remember.</div>
			<br><br>Confirm popup!
			<br><br><img src="lockedinpopup.png" width="50%">
			<div class="imageDescription">You have no choice over what to answer on this one!</div>
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="bugfixes">Bug fixes and tweaks</h4>
			Everyone's favourite part!
			<ul>
				<li>Wannabee will no longer disappear off the map... hopefully.</li>
				<li>Firerate of guns is no longer affected by framerate.</li>
				<li>Enemies will no longer get caught on walls.</li>
				<li>And, as always, the ones that I can't remember off the top of my head.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="smallSpace"></div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<h4 id="postupdatenote">Post-update note</h4>
			This update is hopefully going to change the style of Locked In, turning it from a repetitive, fast paced
			shooter, to a more randomized, chaotic (but not infuriating... yet) arcade game.
			We've tried as hard as we can ('we' being me, alone) to add some more features and content to the game, as well
			as freshening up our website. If you want to support us, visit our <a
				href="https://nikelet.itch.io/lockedinalpha">itch.io page</a> and,
			after we set up donations, donate!
			<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>

					<ul>
						<li>Has multiple different phases</li>
						<li>Spawns in an exclusive enemy (small bee)</li>
						<li>Gives a secret new weapon when defeated!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Fires as quick as an AR</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Your head now moves before your body and gun</li>
						<li>Added a movement counter, and darkness speed indicator</li>
						<li>The gun now goes under your head and over your arms, instead of being on top of both</li>
						<li>A few other teeny tiny ones that I can't remember off the top of my head</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
